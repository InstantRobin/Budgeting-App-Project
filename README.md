## A budgeting program

This is a program designed to facilitate the management of one's money. 
It is able to:
 - Add or remove money from accounts
 - Move money between accounts
 - Log money management history
 - Create graphs and give data on said history
 - Operate with multiple currencies
 
This project is of interest to me because I've always had an interest in data related to my life,
and I've always wanted a system that was more powerful than a spreadsheet but didn't decrease the amount
of control I had over it's operation. It should be useful for anyone who has an interest in managing
their money, especially those who live in multiple countries, like myself.
